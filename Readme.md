# Synchronization with MS Outlook  - a demonstration example


In v23.1+, Scheduler Control supports new APIs and allows you to synchronize user appointments with Microsoft 365 calendars (bi-directionally). Please refer to the [Synchronization with Microsoft 365 Calendars](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/404317/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/import-and-export/synchronization-with-outlook-365-calendars) help topic for details.

You can also use the build-in [DXGoogleCalendarSync](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.GoogleCalendar.DXGoogleCalendarSync) component to set up the synchronization between a Scheduler Control and a Google Calendar: [Google Calendars](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/120605/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/import-and-export/google-calendars).

If the build-in synchronization functionality doesn't meet your requirements, this example allows you to examine the operation ofÂ <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressXtraSchedulerExchangeAppointmentExportSynchronizertopic">AppointmentExportSynchronizer</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressXtraSchedulerExchangeAppointmentImportSynchronizertopic">AppointmentImportSynchronizer</a>Â objects whichÂ enableÂ you to implement your own synchronization method.<br><br><u><strong>WARNING: When you run this example, you can delete all data in your MS Outlook calendar. We suggest that you backup your data prior to running the example.</strong></u>
